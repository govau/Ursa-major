# What is the gov.au analytics service?



This is a whole-of-government analytics dashboard. It displays aggregated metrics from [participating](https://dta.gov.au/our-projects/google-analytics-government/) Australian Government digital services.

## Where does the data come from?

Australian Government digital services. Using government websites or apps creates anonymous data. We combine that data to make a unified view of government services. 

## Who created this?

The gov.au Observatory, a team from the [Digital Transformation Agency](https://dta.gov.au). We use data science to learn how people interact with government.

We also help teams use data by providing:
- premium Google Analytics
- training, education and support
- whole-of-government data analysis.
