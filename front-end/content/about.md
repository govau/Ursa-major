# What is the gov.au analytics service?

This is a whole-of-government analytics dashboard. It currently displays aggregated Google Analytics 360 metrics from [participating Australian Government digital services](https://dta.gov.au/our-projects/google-analytics-government/). We combine this data to make a unified view of government services.

## Where does the data come from?

This data comes from Australian Government digital services. When users access government websites or apps, anonymous data is collected by an analytics service running in the background.

## Who created this?

The gov.au Observatory, a team from the [Digital Transformation Agency](https://dta.gov.au). We use data science to learn how people interact with government.

We also help teams use data by providing:
- premium Google Analytics
- training, education and support
- whole-of-government data analysis.
